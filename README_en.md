Object-Oriented Practice | Aircraft War Android Port - Backend

This script is adapted from an online blog. The link is provided in the code. It is responsible only for data transmission and communication with the client. The game logic is on the Android end.

> Because the school's term "Android port" can be misleading, it led to the game logic being transferred to the Android frontend. Normally, the server should run the game logic, and the frontend should only be responsible for rendering. Given my limited skills at the time, I only realized this issue after completing the frontend. But because it was the end of the semester, it had to stay that way.
